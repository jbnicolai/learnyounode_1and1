Write a program that starts a simple http server on port 3030 and prints the following text on the terminal: `Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3030/`. When a user navigates to the server in his browser it should say `hello <user-agent>`.

## HINTS

* see the NodeJS api documentation on http://npmjs.org/ for further details
* if you are stuck, try to print out the request object to find out where the user-agent is located
