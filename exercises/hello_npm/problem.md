Create a package.json file in a new folder that gives the project a nice name, description and version. Add a dependency for the project that allows for colored console output (eg. https://github.com/sindresorhus/chalk) and write a small problem that prints out the text `awesome colors!`.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

* `npm` has a shorthand for creating package.json files (init)
* you can add dependencies manually to the package.json file or with npm
* as the version for the dependency you can use a specific number (eg. 1.0.0) or `*`, if you want the newest version (more about the npm version can be read here: http://semver.org/)
